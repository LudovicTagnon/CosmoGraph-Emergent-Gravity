Editors / Referees,

We submit **“CosmoGraph: Emergent Gravity from Information Networks”**, which bridges network theory and observational cosmology with three falsifiable results:

1) **Relativistic-like clustering from centrality**  
   A scale-free graph with vector dynamics reproduces a Newtonian $1/r^2$ decay (α≈2.04) and emergent time (Page–Wootters, fidelity 1.0).

2) **Real-world correlation (SDSS, Great Wall slice)**  
   Using 20k SDSS galaxies (0.04<z<0.12), k-NN weighted by luminosity yields a correlation (force vs. eigenvector centrality) of 0.223 (buffered). A “realistic” theory (RSD + mass noise) predicts 0.259 (vs. ideal 0.397), closing most of the gap by observational effects.

3) **Power spectrum concordance (cleaned)**  
   The raw P(k) slopes are −2.98 (mass) vs. −2.72 (topology); after dividing by a random catalog (voxel window), the transfer-function slopes converge to −1.61 (mass) vs. −1.32 (topology), demonstrating that the **excess clustering** is captured by centrality (b≈1.53).

Key figures: `power_spectrum_combined.png`, `final_theory_vs_reality.png`, `structural_comparison_2d_XZ.png`.  
All code/data/scripts are reproducible in the public repository (SDSS slice + spectral analysis).

Why it matters: It proposes an information-theoretic origin for gravity/matter clustering, reinterpreting “dark matter” as **topological centrality** rather than new particles, and confronts this claim with real data.

We believe this is of interest to readers in cosmology, complex networks, and emergent gravity. We welcome critical review and suggestions for extending the analysis to BOSS/eBOSS or weak-lensing datasets.

Sincerely,  
The CosmoGraph Team
